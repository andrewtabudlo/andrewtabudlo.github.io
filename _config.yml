user_description: I am a web developer with training in front-end and back-end technologies. Coming from a background in IT, I also have experience in server administration, both hardware and virtual. When Iâ€™m not on the job, I love searching for new music for my playlists, tinkering with my Linux workstations, and trying out new restaurants in the area.
